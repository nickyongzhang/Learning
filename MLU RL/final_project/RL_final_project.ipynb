    "+ A sequence of images (frames) representing each frame of the Pong game.\n",
    "+ An indication when we’ve won or lost the game.\n",
    "+ An opponent agent that is the traditional Pong computer player.\n",
    "+ An agent that we control and can tell to move up or down in each frame.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Neural Network: Multi Layer Perceptron\n",
    "This is the simple neural network that you are going to implement here. <br/>\n",
    "A perceptron is a linear classifier; that is, it is an algorithm that classifies input by separating the two categories with a straight line. <br/>\n",
    "Input is typically a **feature vector x** multiplied by **weights w** and added to a **bias b**:<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = w * x + b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multilayer perceptron is the hello world of deep learning: a good place to start when you are learning about deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a deep, artificial neural network. It is composed of more than one perceptron. They are composed of an input layer to receive the signal, an output layer that makes a decision or prediction about the input, and in between those two, an arbitrary number of hidden layers that are the true computational engine of the MLP. MLPs with one hidden layer are capable of approximating any continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training involves adjusting the parameters, or the weights and biases, of the model in order to minimize error, expressed by a **loss function**. <br/>\n",
    "**Backpropagation** is used to make those weigh and bias adjustments relative to the error, and the error itself can be measured in a variety of ways, including by root mean squared error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedforward networks such as MLPs are like tennis, or ping pong. They are mainly involved in two motions, a constant back and forth. You can think of this ping pong of guesses and answers as a kind of accelerated science, since each guess is a test of what we think we know, and each response is feedback letting us know how wrong we are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **forward pass**, the signal flow moves from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer, and the decision of the output layer is measured against the ground truth labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **backward pass**, using backpropagation and the chain rule of calculus, partial derivatives of the error function w.r.t. the various weights and biases are back-propagated through the MLP. That act of differentiation gives us a **gradient**, or a landscape of error, along which the parameters that may be adjusted as they move the MLP one step closer to the error minimum. This can be done with any gradient-based optimisation algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent. The network keeps playing that game of tennis until the error can go no lower. This state is known as convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have noticed, our dense layer only have linear functions, and any combination of linear function only results in the linear output. As we want our MLP to be flexible and learn non-linear decision boundaries, we also need to introduce **non-linearity** into the network. We achieve the task of introducing non-linearity by adding **activation functions**. There are various kinds of activation function which can be used, but we will be implementing **Rectified Linear Units (ReLu)** which is one of the popular activation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLu function\n",
    "ReLU function is a simple function which is zero for any input value below zero and the same value for values greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = max(0,x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The log probability\n",
    "Now that we understand dense layer and also understand the purpose of activation function, the only thing left is training the network. For training a neural network, we need to have a **loss function** and every layer should have a **feed-forward loop** and **backpropagation loop**.\n",
    "Actually, we are computing our gradient during this backpropagation loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedforward loop** takes an input and generates output for making a prediction and **backpropagation loop** helps in training the model by adjusting weights in the layer to lower the output loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below exemplify the use of the log probability function appliyed to our supervised learning problem.<br/>\n",
    "In ordinary supervised learning we would feed an image to the network and get some probabilities, e.g. for two classes UP and DOWN. \n",
    "The figure shows the log probabilities (-1.2, -0.36) for UP and DOWN instead of the raw probabilities (30% and 70% in this case), because we always optimize the log probability of the correct label. <br/>\n",
    "Now, in supervised learning we would have access to a label. For example, we might be told that the correct thing to do right now is to go UP (label 0). In an implementation we would enter gradient of 1.0 on the log probability of UP and run backprop to compute the gradient vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\nabla_w log(y = UP|x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gradient would tell us how we should change every one of our million parameters to make the network slightly more likely to predict UP. For example, one of the million parameters in the network might have a gradient of -2.1, which means that if we were to increase that parameter by a small positive amount (e.g. 0.001), the log probability of UP would decrease by 2.1 * 0.001 (decrease due to the negative sign). If we then did a parameter update, our network would now be slightly more likely to predict UP when it sees a very similar image in the future.\n",

    "### The Sigmoig Function\n",
    "We are going to use another activation function here. The sigmoid function.\n",
    "The sigmoid non-linearity has the mathematical form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma(x) = 1 / (1 - e^{-x})$\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a real-valued number and “squashes” it into a range between 0 and 1. In particular, large negative numbers become 0 and large positive numbers become 1.<br/> \n",
    "For our Pong problem, we are going to output the probability of an UP action."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Policy Gradients. \n",
    "Remember that we don't have actual labels for our supervised learning approach, so what do we do?<br/>\n",
    "Here is the **Policy Gradients solution**.\n",
    "Let's look at an example below to ilustrate it. <br/>\n",
    "Our policy network calculated probability of going UP as 30% (logprob -1.2) and DOWN as 70% (logprob -0.36). We will now sample an action from this distribution; E.g. suppose we sample DOWN, and we will execute it in the game. At this point notice one interesting fact: We could immediately fill in a gradient of 1.0 for DOWN as we did in supervised learning, and find the gradient vector that would encourage the network to be slightly more likely to do the DOWN action in the future. So we can immediately evaluate this gradient and that’s great, but the problem is that at least for now we do not yet know if going DOWN is good. <br/>\n",
    "But the critical point is that that’s okay, because we can simply wait a bit and see! For example in Pong we could wait until the end of the game, then take the reward we get (either +1 if we won or -1 if we lost), and enter that scalar as the gradient for the action we have taken (DOWN in this case). In the example below, going DOWN ended up to us losing the game (-1 reward). So if we fill in -1 for log probability of DOWN and do backprop we will find a gradient that discourages the network to take the DOWN action for that input in the future (and rightly so, since taking that action led to us losing the game).\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/RL-assign4-1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a stochastic policy that samples actions and then actions that happen to eventually lead to good outcomes get encouraged in the future, and actions taken that lead to bad outcomes get discouraged. Also, the reward does not even need to be +1 or -1 if we win the game eventually. <br/>\n",
    "It can be an arbitrary measure of some kind of eventual quality. For example if things turn out really well it could be 10.0, which we would then enter as the gradient instead of -1 to start off backprop. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Training protocol. \n",
    "So here is how the training will work in detail. <br/>\n",
    "We will initialize the policy network with some W1, W2 and play 100 games of Pong (we call these policy “rollouts”). Lets assume that each game is made up of 200 frames so in total we’ve made 20,000 decisions for going UP or DOWN and for each one of these we know the parameter gradient, which tells us how we should change the parameters if we wanted to encourage that decision in that state in the future. <br/>\n",
    "All that remains now is to label every decision we’ve made as good or bad. For example suppose we won 12 games and lost 88. We’ll take all **200x12** = 2400 decisions we made in the winning games and do a positive update (filling in a +1.0 in the gradient for the sampled action, doing backprop, and parameter update encouraging the actions we picked in all those states). And we’ll take the other **200x88** = 17600 decisions we made in the losing games and do a negative update (discouraging whatever we did). <br/>\n",
    "The network will now become slightly more likely to repeat actions that worked, and slightly less likely to repeat actions that didn’t work. Now we play another 100 games with our new, slightly improved policy and rinse and repeat.\n",

The most recent action or frame prior to a reward being received by the Agent is the most relevant and therefore should be encouraged in the case of a positive reward and discouraged for a negative reward. <br/> \n",
